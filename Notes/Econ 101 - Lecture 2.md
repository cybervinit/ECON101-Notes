### The Economic Way of Thinking

Six key ideas:

1. A choice is a **tradeoff** $ \rightarrow $ to get *X*, you need to give up *Y*.
2. People make **rational decisions** after comparing the pros and cons of the results of the decisions
3. *Benefit* is what you gain from something (something positive to you)
4. Cost is what you give up for something (something that you lose and don't like that you lose it)
5. Most choices 
6. Choices respond to incentives (i.e. If 20% of the questions from *quiz 1* would be on the exam, your choice would be to <u>focus more on quiz 1</u>)



#### 1. A Choice is a tradeoff

The *economic way* of thinking places **scarcity** and its implication, choice, at the center stage.

### Opportunity Cost

The **Opportunity Cost** of something that is the *Highest valued* alternative that must be given up by choosing the choice that you chose.

### Choosing at the Margin

- Making choices at the **margin** means looking at the tradeoffs that arise from making small changes to the activity.
- **Marginal Benefit**: the benefit from making a small changes to an activity
- **Marginal Cost**: the cost of making the small change
- *Example:* Studying for one more night (the night before) an exam could result in a better grade vs losing the sleep for the night

[^ NOTE ]: The central point of economics is to analyze how changes to incentives result in changes in peoples choices
